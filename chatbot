        const sdgInfo = {
            "goal 1": `*Goal 1: End poverty in all its forms everywhere*
Poverty is more than the lack of income. It includes hunger, lack of shelter, and limited access to health services. 
- In 2015, about 10% of the world’s population lived on less than $1.90 per day.
- Social protection programs have been proven to reduce poverty but are often underfunded.
- Eradicating poverty also requires economic growth and support for sustainable livelihoods.`,
            "goal 2": `*Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture*
Hunger remains one of the most urgent development challenges.
- 690 million people were undernourished in 2019.
- The world produces enough food, but access is unequal, especially in conflict areas.
- Sustainable farming practices, including organic farming and soil restoration, are crucial for long-term food security.`,
            "goal 3": `*Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages*
Health is fundamental to sustainable development. 
- Since 1990, child mortality has been cut by half, but 5.3 million children under age 5 still died in 2018.
- HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria deaths have been reduced, yet access to healthcare remains unequal, especially in developing countries.
- Universal health coverage (UHC) is a key to ensuring that everyone gets the healthcare they need without suffering financial hardship.`,
            "goal 4": `*Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all*
Education is a powerful tool to escape poverty and reduce inequalities.
- In 2019, 258 million children and youth were out of school, including 59 million of primary school age.
- Quality education should be accessible to all, with a focus on gender equality and teacher quality.
- The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education for millions of children, making the goal even more critical.`,
            "goal 5": `*Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls*
Gender equality is a fundamental human right and is necessary for a peaceful, prosperous world.
- Globally, 1 in 3 women has experienced physical or sexual violence.
- Women and girls carry out 75% of unpaid care work worldwide.
- Empowering women includes addressing legal discrimination, access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities.`,
            "goal 6": `*Goal 6: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all*
Water is essential for human survival and the health of ecosystems.
- 2.2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water.
- 4.2 billion people lack safely managed sanitation services.
- Ensuring sustainable water management involves protecting ecosystems, reducing pollution, and investing in efficient infrastructure.`,
            "goal 7": `*Goal 7: Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all*
Energy is essential for modern life, from lighting homes to powering hospitals.
- 759 million people still have no access to electricity, with 75% of them living in Sub-Saharan Africa.
- Renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, are key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combatting climate change.`,
            "goal 8": `*Goal 8: Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all*
Economic growth must be inclusive to provide jobs and improve living standards.
- The global unemployment rate increased to 5.6% in 2020 due to COVID-19.
- More than 470 million jobs are needed for new entrants to the labor market between 2016 and 2030.
- Supporting small and medium-sized enterprises is key to creating employment opportunities.`,
            "goal 9": `*Goal 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation*
Infrastructure and industrialization drive economic development and human well-being.
- 1 in 5 people worldwide still lacks access to mobile broadband networks.
- Promoting innovative technologies and providing financial support to developing nations can foster sustainable industrial growth.`,
            "goal 10": `*Goal 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries*
Inequality persists in income, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, and more.
- Income inequality has been rising in many countries.
- Reducing inequality requires targeted policies that focus on disadvantaged populations, access to economic resources, and more inclusive social policies.`,
            "goal 11": `*Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable*
Urbanization is one of the most transformative trends of the 21st century.
- By 2030, around 60% of the world’s population is expected to live in urban areas.
- Ensuring sustainable urbanization involves creating affordable housing, green spaces, and efficient transport systems.`,
            "goal 12": `*Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns*
Unsustainable consumption and production patterns are the root causes of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution.
- Food waste amounts to about 1.3 billion tons per year, while 820 million people are undernourished.
- Reducing waste and encouraging recycling is critical to lowering the impact of consumption on the environment.`,
            "goal 13": `*Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts*
Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time.
- The world is not on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, and global warming could exceed 3°C by 2100.
- Rapid, far-reaching changes in energy systems, cities, and industries are needed to limit global warming to 1.5°C.`,
            "goal 14": `*Goal 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources*
Oceans are vital to human well-being, providing food, energy, and climate regulation.
- Overfishing and marine pollution threaten ecosystems and livelihoods.
- Protecting marine areas, reducing plastic pollution, and promoting sustainable fisheries are essential steps.`,
            "goal 15": `*Goal 15: Protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems*
Forests, wetlands, drylands, and mountains are under threat from deforestation, desertification, and biodiversity loss.
- Around 13 million hectares of forest are lost each year.
- Land degradation and the loss of biodiversity undermine food security and drive mass migration.`,
            "goal 16": `*Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies, provide access to justice, and build accountable institutions*
Peaceful, just, and inclusive societies are necessary for sustainable development.
- More than 70 million people have been forcibly displaced by conflict and persecution.
- Reducing violence, promoting the rule of law, and ensuring equal access to justice are critical to building peaceful societies.`,
            "goal 17": `*Goal 17: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development*
Achieving the SDGs requires collaboration between governments, private sectors, civil society, and international organizations.
- Development aid plays a key role in supporting developing nations, but financial resources have been falling short of commitments.
- Strengthening global partnerships, improving data collection, and ensuring effective governance are crucial for the successful implementation of the SDGs.`
